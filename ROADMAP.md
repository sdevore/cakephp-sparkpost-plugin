# Roadmap

This document outlines the features that are planned for the plugin and their
estimated ship dates. Each feature will be accompanied by a status that
indicates its current level of completion:

* **NOT STARTED** - In planning stages only - implementation has not begun
* **IN PROGRESS** - Implementation has begun
* **NEEDS TESTING** - Implementation is complete but needs to be tested
* **ABANDONED** - Implementation has been abandoned for some reason
* **NEXT RELEASE** - Feature will be available in the next major release

Enterprising users are encouraged to pick un-started or abandoned features,
implement the features for themselves, and submit a pull request! If
submitting a pull request, please be sure to adhere to the contribution
guidelines (see CONTRIBUTING.md for more information).
